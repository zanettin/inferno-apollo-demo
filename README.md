# inferno-apollo example app
This app is a combination of the `swapi graphql api`, `create-inferno-app`, `inferno-apollo` and `incompose`.
To play around with this example start the client as well as the server. If everything works correctly, you should see a list of star wars movies.

## install
```
git clone git@github.com:zanettin/inferno-apollo-demo.git
cd inferno-apollo-demo
npm install
```

## start

### server
```
npm run start:server
```
this command starts a node/express server on `localhost:4000`

### frontend
```
npm start
```
this command starts a node server with live reload on `localhost:3000`

## GraphiQL
This repo also contains the graphiQL interface to test your queries.
Just navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to find the interface.
